# Deferred Work

Items surfaced during code review that are intentionally deferred. Each entry cites the source review and links back to the story spec.

## Deferred from: code review of story 3-3-jailed-team-identification-and-tie-breakers (2026-04-25)

- **Picks-lock guard on jailed POST** — `src/app/api/admin/nfl/week-jailed/route.ts` POST + `src/lib/nfl/jailed-computation.ts` upsert. Once the picks model lands (Story 3.4/3.5), POST must refuse (or require an explicit `force=true` + audit log) when a week's picks are already locked, so jailed cannot silently rewrite scoring after the deadline. Today the dev choice "admin recompute by design" is per spec, but it becomes a Critical-risk path the moment picks exist.
- **Transactional read+resolve+upsert for jailed compute** — `src/lib/nfl/jailed-computation.ts`. Wrap `nflGame.findMany` + `getEffectiveOddsLinesForWeek` + `randomBytes` + `prisma.nflWeekJailedTeam.upsert` in a `prisma.$transaction` with row-level locking on `(nflSeasonYear, weekNumber)` so two concurrent admin POSTs cannot generate independent random seeds and silently overwrite each other. Low practical risk on an admin-only endpoint but real once an automation runner exists; needs a refactor of `getEffectiveOddsLinesForWeek` to accept the transaction client.
- **Per-stage survivors in jailed `audit`** — `src/lib/domain/jailed.ts` `buildResult`. Persist `afterMoneyline` and `afterSpread` slices alongside the full `candidates` array so a verifier (Story 4.4 jailed verification view) can see exactly which candidates reached the SPREAD or RANDOM stage without re-running the algorithm in their head.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-4-pick-api-with-server-side-validation (2026-04-26)

- **Concurrent `isCreate` 201/200 status code race** — `src/app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/picks/route.ts` lines 234–244. Under READ COMMITTED, two concurrent first-time POSTs for the same `(leagueMembershipId, seasonId, nflWeekNumber)` both see `existing = null` and both return 201. Pick data is correct (upsert wins); only the status code is wrong for the second caller. Fix requires SERIALIZABLE isolation for the transaction or extracting create/update from upsert side-effects (not directly supported in Prisma). Semantic-only error; low practical risk given single-user pick flow.
- **No route-layer test for 201/200 and idempotency** — `src/app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/picks/route.ts`. The "idempotent repeat of same body → 200" clause in AC1 and the 201-on-create branch are uncovered at the route level. Spec explicitly says "Prisma optional in route tests." Defer to when integration/e2e test infrastructure is established.

## Follow-up for Story 3.5 (from 3.4)

- **`assertPickMutationAllowed`** — `src/lib/picks/assert-pick-mutation-allowed.ts` is a no-op placeholder. Story 3.5 should implement deadline / week-lock checks here (same handler) and align with the picks-lock guard on admin jailed POST (see first bullet above).
