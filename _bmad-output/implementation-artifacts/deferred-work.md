# Deferred Work

Items surfaced during code review that are intentionally deferred. Each entry cites the source review and links back to the story spec.

## Deferred from: code review of story 3-3-jailed-team-identification-and-tie-breakers (2026-04-25)

- **Picks-lock guard on jailed POST (done in 3.5)** — `computeAndPersistNflWeekJailed` returns **409** `WEEK_PICK_WINDOW_CLOSED` when the pick window is past the story 3.5 deadline (schedule + kickoff data present). A future option: `force=true` + audit (Epic 4 / one-line follow-up) if recompute is ever required after lock.
- **Transactional read+resolve+upsert for jailed compute** — `src/lib/nfl/jailed-computation.ts`. Wrap `nflGame.findMany` + `getEffectiveOddsLinesForWeek` + `randomBytes` + `prisma.nflWeekJailedTeam.upsert` in a `prisma.$transaction` with row-level locking on `(nflSeasonYear, weekNumber)` so two concurrent admin POSTs cannot generate independent random seeds and silently overwrite each other. Low practical risk on an admin-only endpoint but real once an automation runner exists; needs a refactor of `getEffectiveOddsLinesForWeek` to accept the transaction client.
- **Per-stage survivors in jailed `audit`** — `src/lib/domain/jailed.ts` `buildResult`. Persist `afterMoneyline` and `afterSpread` slices alongside the full `candidates` array so a verifier (Story 4.4 jailed verification view) can see exactly which candidates reached the SPREAD or RANDOM stage without re-running the algorithm in their head.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-4-pick-api-with-server-side-validation (2026-04-26)

- **Concurrent `isCreate` 201/200 status code race** — `src/app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/picks/route.ts` lines 234–244. Under READ COMMITTED, two concurrent first-time POSTs for the same `(leagueMembershipId, seasonId, nflWeekNumber)` both see `existing = null` and both return 201. Pick data is correct (upsert wins); only the status code is wrong for the second caller. Fix requires SERIALIZABLE isolation for the transaction or extracting create/update from upsert side-effects (not directly supported in Prisma). Semantic-only error; low practical risk given single-user pick flow.
- **No route-layer test for 201/200 and idempotency** — `src/app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/picks/route.ts`. The "idempotent repeat of same body → 200" clause in AC1 and the 201-on-create branch are uncovered at the route level. Spec explicitly says "Prisma optional in route tests." Defer to when integration/e2e test infrastructure is established.

## Follow-up for Story 3.5 (from 3.4)

- *(Resolved in 3.5 — see `checkPickMutationDeadline`, `src/lib/domain/pick-deadline.ts`, and jailed `WEEK_PICK_WINDOW_CLOSED`.)*

## Planned follow-on: Story 3.10 — kickoff-time weather forecast (deferred from 3.6, 2026-04-28)

**Context:** Story 3.6 ships **current-conditions** weather (`/data/2.5/weather`) — conditions at the moment the picks page loads. This is a useful approximation but not a kickoff-time forecast.

**Goal:** Replace or supplement the current-conditions call with a **point-in-time forecast** for each game's `kickoffAt` at the home team's stadium coordinates.

**Key design decisions to resolve in 3.10:**

- **Provider choice** — must support lat/lon + target datetime. OpenWeatherMap options:
  - `/data/2.5/forecast` (free): 3-hour-step forecasts, up to **5 days out**. Adequate for games within the week; useless for games > 5 days away.
  - One Call API 3.0 (`/data/3.0/onecall`): hourly up to **48 h**, daily up to **8 days**. Free tier requires credit card; 1,000 calls/day free. Better fit for full-week previews.
  - Any other provider returning hourly lat/lon forecast is a drop-in behind `fetchWeatherForTeam`.
- **Fallback window:** When `kickoffAt` is outside the provider's forecast horizon (e.g. week loaded on Monday, game on Sunday +10 days), fail-soft to `null` (no chip) rather than returning stale current conditions — **do not silently show the wrong data**.
- **Dependency on 3.9:** Reliable UTC `kickoffAt` per `NflGame` row is a hard prerequisite. Until 3.9 ships, seed-only Week 1 games have fixed kickoff times — workable for a limited pilot but not for the full 18-week season.

**Interface change is minimal — already isolated:** `fetchWeatherForTeam` in `src/lib/integrations/weather/client.ts` currently ignores the game's time. Signature change to `fetchWeatherForGame(abbreviation: string, kickoffAt: Date): Promise<WeatherData | null>` and updating the one call site in `src/lib/picks/build-league-picks-week-view.ts` is the full surface area.

**No schema change required** — `WeatherData` shape (`tempF`, `condition`, `windMph`) is sufficient; forecast APIs return the same fields in different endpoints.

**Suggested acceptance criteria for 3.10:**
1. Weather chip reflects **forecast conditions at `kickoffAt`**, not page-load time.
2. Games with `kickoffAt` beyond the provider's horizon render **no weather chip** (fail-soft, no crash).
3. `WEATHER_API_KEY` still the only secret; no `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
4. `npm test` passes; weather client covered by fixture-based unit test for the forecast path.

**Blocked by:** Story 3.9 (real `kickoffAt` data for all weeks).

## Deferred from: code review of 3-6-picks-ui-matchups-odds-spread-weather-optional (2026-04-28)

- **Keyboard/a11y for clickable team selection** — `MatchupCard` propagates `onClick` but has no `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, or `onKeyDown`; story 3.6 is display-only so this is deferred to Story 3.7 when `onTeamSelect` is wired.
- **Weather caching** — `cache: "no-store"` on every SSR render will exhaust the OpenWeatherMap free-tier quota under any meaningful traffic. Spec open questions explicitly defer caching to performance testing. Add `next: { revalidate }` or an in-process TTL cache in a future iteration.
- **Domed stadium weather display** — Weather conditions are fetched and shown for fully-enclosed stadiums (Allegiant/LV, US Bank/MIN, SoFi/LAC+LAR, Lucas Oil/IND, Ford Field/DET, NRG/HOU). Showing temperature and wind for a climate-controlled game is misleading. Add a `dome: true` flag to `NFL_STADIUM_BY_TEAM_ABBR` and skip weather fetch for dome stadiums. Product decision required before implementing.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-7-jailed-and-already-picked-ux-with-countdown-and-status (2026-05-09)

- **Prisma patch-level bump + seed session note** — `package.json` / `package-lock.json` move `@prisma/client` and `prisma` from 7.7.x to 7.8.x; `prisma/seed.cjs` adds a console reminder to re-auth after migrate reset. Unrelated to 3.7 acceptance criteria; treat as repo hygiene when convenient.
- **44×44 touch target for anti-jailed “2 PTS” chip** — `MatchupCard` uses MUI `Chip` `size="small"`, which may be under NFR8. Defer sizing pass until a11y QA or explicit design direction.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-5-deadline-enforcement-server-authority (2026-04-26)

- **`GAMES_NOT_LOADED` message misleading for null-`kickoffAt` case** — `src/app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/picks/route.ts`. When games exist but one has a null kickoff, the message says "No game schedule data is available" — implying no ingestion occurred. A distinct message or code for the partial-ingestion case would be clearer, but the spec sanctions reusing this validation.
- **`checkPickMutationDeadline` returns null for empty games — latent bypass** — `src/lib/picks/assert-pick-mutation-allowed.ts`. The documented precondition ("call only after games are loaded") prevents this in practice, but any future caller that omits the route-level guard silently bypasses deadline enforcement. Consider an invariant throw on empty input.
- **`now` not injectable in `computeAndPersistNflWeekJailed`** — `src/lib/nfl/jailed-computation.ts`. The jailed recompute path captures `now` internally, making the deadline check path difficult to unit test deterministically. Align with `checkPickMutationDeadline`'s injected `now` pattern in a future refactor.
- **Thursday 8:10 PM cutoff is a magic literal, not a named constant** — `src/lib/domain/pick-deadline.ts`. The `20, 10` hour/minute values in `lockByThursdayDefaultUtc` and the associated test assertions are scattered. A named export (`THURSDAY_LOCK_HOUR`, `THURSDAY_LOCK_MINUTE`) would create a single authoritative source.
- **`gamesWithKickoff` manually reconstructed rather than type-narrowed** — `src/app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/picks/route.ts`. The loop that rebuilds each game as `{ homeTeamId, awayTeamId, kickoffAt }` sheds future Prisma fields. A type-narrowing filter (`.filter((g): g is ... => g.kickoffAt != null)`) avoids the parallel allocation.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-8-nfl-team-logos-discovery-and-implementation.md (2026-05-10)

- **`resolveNflLogoSrc` imports full `nfl-teams.json` into the client bundle** via `TeamLogo` — file is small (~32 teams); acceptable MVP tradeoff. Optional follow-up: codegen or a static uppercase `Set` so the client never imports full JSON metadata.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-9-nfl-schedule-provider-spike-and-sync.md (2026-05-23)

- **Serial `for-await` upserts inside `$transaction`** (`src/lib/nfl/sync-nfl-schedule.ts`) — N sequential DB round-trips for up to 280+ games; `Promise.all` or a batch upsert strategy would improve throughput. Admin-only low-frequency operation; acceptable at MVP scale.
- **Overly permissive Zod schemas** (`src/lib/integrations/api-sports-nfl/schemas.ts`) — all team/date fields are optional; validation errors surface only at the mapping layer with less precise messages. Consistent with existing `the-odds-api` integration pattern; revisit if schema drift causes mapping noise.
- **Rename migration adds noise** (`prisma/migrations/20260511022811_2026_first_games_migration/migration.sql`) — only truncates an index name to fit Postgres identifier limits; already applied to DB; no functional change.
- **All 32 teams loaded from DB on every sync call** (`src/lib/nfl/sync-nfl-schedule.ts`) — negligible at current scale; worth caching or narrowing if team table ever grows meaningfully.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-10-kickoff-time-weather-forecast (2026-05-24)

- **`scripts/test-weather.ts` unhandled promise rejection** — `main()` is called without `.catch()`; an uncaught rejection will silently exit with a non-zero code. Dev utility only; add `.catch(console.error)` if the script sees repeated use.
- **SoFi Stadium (LAC/LAR) "retractable" classification** — The roof is a fixed translucent canopy with open sides rather than a true retractable mechanism. Whether weather "applies" is debatable. Revisit stadium metadata accuracy when the roof feature is formally specced.
- **Non-deterministic `Date.now()` in horizon tests** — Tests compute future offsets from live `Date.now()`, creating a theoretical flake at the 5-day boundary window. Replace with `vi.useFakeTimers()` if this becomes a CI reliability concern.
